Measuring brain activity is at task generally left for EEG or fMRI. However, there is a lesser known imaging technique known as near infrared spectrophotometry, in which near infrared light is shown into the patients head to measure changes in oxygenation that directly relate to brain activity. This paper describes a low-cost, wireless, portable  near infrared spectrophotometry system that is able to measure brain activity. The results show that not able is the system able to measure changes in brain activity relating to motor movement, visual stimulation, and intense thinking, it is also able to measure muscle activity.
