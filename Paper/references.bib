	abstract={We have designed a versatile, multi-channel near-infrared spectrophotometry (NIRS) instrument for the purpose of mapping neuronal activation in the neonatal and adult brain in response to motor, tactile, and visual stimulation. The optical linearity, stability, and high signal to noise ratio (>70 dB) of the instrument were demonstrated using an in vitro validation procedure. In vivo measurements on the adult forearm were also performed. Changes in oxygenation, induced by arterial occlusion of the forearm, were recorded and were shown to compare well with measurements acquired using a conventional NIRS instrument. To demonstrate the capabilities of the instrument, functional measurements in adults and neonates were performed. The instrument exhibited the capability to differentiate with a spatial resolution in the order of cm, local activation patterns associated with a finger tapping sequence.},

For estimating the precision, we calculated the noise level of the concentration changes as the uncertainty in measurements using several wavelength pairs of light. Seven laser diodes (664-848 nm) were used simultaneously for spectroscopic measurement of brain activity during finger motor stimulation. We also used the analysis of error propagation from the uncertainty in direct measurements of absorbance changes to estimate indirectly the uncertainty of concentration changes. The measurement of the concentration changes made using an 830/664-nm pair are two times (oxy-Hb) and six times (deoxy-Hb) more precise than those made using an 830/782-nm pair.},

	abstract={BACKGROUND: Newborns with critical health conditions are monitored in neonatal intensive care units (NICU). In NICU, one of the most important problems that they face is the risk of brain injury. There is a need for continuous monitoring of newborn's brain function to prevent any potential brain injury. This type of monitoring should not interfere with intensive care of the newborn. Therefore, it should be non-invasive and portable. METHODS: In this paper, a low-cost, battery operated, dual wavelength, continuous wave near infrared spectroscopy system for continuous bedside hemodynamic monitoring of neonatal brain is presented. The system has been designed to optimize SNR by optimizing the wavelength-multiplexing parameters with special emphasis on safety issues concerning burn injuries. SNR improvement by utilizing the entire dynamic range has been satisfied with modifications in analog circuitry. RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: As a result, a shot-limited SNR of 67 dB has been achieved for 10 Hz temporal resolution. The system can operate more than 30 hours without recharging when an off-the-shelf 1850 mAh-7.2 V battery is used. Laboratory tests with optical phantoms and preliminary data recorded in NICU demonstrate the potential of the system as a reliable clinical tool to be employed in the bedside regional monitoring of newborn brain metabolism under intensive care.},

	abstract={Brain activity is associated with changes in optical properties of brain tissue. Optical measurements during brain activation can assess haemoglobin oxygenation, cytochrome-c-oxidase redox state, and two types of changes in light scattering reflecting either membrane potential (fast signal) or cell swelling (slow signal), respectively. In previous studies of exposed brain tissue, optical imaging of brain activity has been achieved at high temporal and microscopical spatial resolution. Now, using near-infrared light that can penetrate biological tissue reasonably well, it has become possible to assess brain activity in human subjects through the intact skull non-invasively. After early studies employing single-site near-infrared spectroscopy, first near-infrared imaging devices are being applied successfully for low-resolution functional brain imaging. Advantages of the optical methods include biochemical specificity, a temporal resolution in the millisecond range, the potential of measuring intracellular and intravascular events simultaneously and the portability of the devices enabling bedside examinations.},

	abstract={The optical differential pathlength factor (DPF) is an important parameter for physiological measurement using near infrared spectroscopy, but for the human adult head it has been available only for the forehead. Here we report measured DPF results for the forehead, somatosensory motor and occipital regions from measurements on 11 adult volunteers using a time-resolved optical imaging system. The optode separation was about 30 mm and the wavelengths used were 759 nm, 799 nm and 834 nm. Measured DPFs were 7.25 for the central forehead and 6.25 for the temple region at 799 nm. For the central somatosensory and occipital areas (10 mm above the inion), DPFs at 799 nm are 7.5 and 8.75, respectively. Less than 10\% decreases of DPF for all these regions were observed when the wavelength increased from 759 nm to 834 nm. To compare these DPF maps with the anatomical structure of the head, a Monte Carlo simulation was carried out to calculate DPF for these regions by using a two-layered semi-infinite model and assuming the thickness of the upper layer to be the sum of the thicknesses of scalp and skull, which was measured from MRI images of a subject's head. The DPF data will be useful for quantitative monitoring of the haemodynamic changes occurring in adult heads.},

	abstract={The modified Beer-Lambert law (MBLL) is the basis of continuous-wave near-infrared tissue spectroscopy (cwNIRS). The differential form of MBLL (dMBLL) states that the change in light attenuation is proportional to the changes in the concentrations of tissue chromophores, mainly oxy- and deoxyhaemoglobin. If attenuation changes are measured at two or more wavelengths, concentration changes can be calculated. The dMBLL is based on two assumptions: (1) the absorption of the tissue changes homogeneously, and (2) the scattering loss is constant. It is known that absorption changes are usually inhomogeneous, and therefore dMBLL underestimates the changes in concentrations (partial volume effect) and every calculated value is influenced by the change in the concentration of other chromophores (cross-talk between chromophores). However, the error introduced by the second assumption (cross-talk of scattering changes) has not been assessed previously. An analytically treatable special case (semi-infinite, homogeneous medium, with optical properties of the cerebral cortex) is utilized here to estimate its order of magnitude. We show that the per cent change of the transport scattering coefficient and that of the absorption coefficient have an approximately equal effect on the changes of attenuation, and a 1\% increase in scattering increases the estimated concentration changes by about 0.5 microM.},

As expected, spectral absorption curves of similar shape were found, but the small differences between fetal and adult hemoglobin absorptivity were important enough that they should be taken into account in multicomponent analysis of hemoglobin derivatives. Common pulse oximeters, however, involving light of 660 and 940 nm, are so insensitive to the presence of fetal hemoglobin that they can be used safely in neonates. The error in pulse oximetry caused by the presence of carboxyhemoglobin is insubstantial, but methemoglobin gives either an understimation or an overestimation at high or low oxygen saturation, respectively, the turning point being near 70\% saturation.},

	abstract={Near-Infrared Spectroscopy (NIRS) and diffuse optical imaging (DOI) are increasingly used to detect hemodynamic changes in the cerebral cortex induced by brain activity. Until recently, the small number of optodes in NIRS instruments has hampered measurement of optical signals from diverse brain regions. Our new DOI system has 32 detectors and 32 sources; by arranging them in a specific pattern, we can cover most of the adult head. With the increased number of optodes, we can collect optical data from prefrontal, sensorimotor, and visual cortices in both hemispheres simultaneously. We describe the system and report system characterization measurements on phantoms as well as on human subjects at rest and during visual, motor, and cognitive stimulation. Taking advantage of the system's larger number of sources and detectors, we explored the spatiotemporal patterns of physiological signals during rest. These physiological signals, arising from cardiac, respiratory, and blood-pressure modulations, interfere with measurement of the hemodynamic response to brain stimulation. Whole-head optical measurements, in addition to providing maps of multiple brain regions' responses to brain activation, will enable better understandings of the physiological signals, ultimately leading to better signal processing algorithms to distinguish physiological signal clutter from brain activation signals.},
