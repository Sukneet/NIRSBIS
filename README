Design of a Near Infrared Spectrophotometry Brain Imaging System

Measuring brain activity is at task generally left for EEG or fMRI. However, there is a lesser known imaging technique known as near infrared spectrophotometry in which near infrared light is shone into the patients head to measure changes in oxygenation that directly relates to brain activity. This paper describes a low-cost, wireless, portable near infrared spectrophotometry system that is able to measure brain activity. The results show that not only is the system able to measure changes in brain activity relating to motor movement, visual stimulation, and intense thinking, but it is also able to measure muscle activity.
